\section{Experimental Setup}

\section{Experimental reagents and equipments}

Fresh eggs, wall-warming micrococcus

NaCl, NaH2PO4, NaOH, (NH4)2SO4, concentrated hydrochloric acid

Comas Brilliant Blue G250, Comas Brilliant Blue R250, 0.45 μm filter
membrane, CM Sepharose Fast Flow (GE), Sephacryl-S200 (GE), constant
flow pump, UV monitor, UV-Vis spectrophotometer, fraction collector,
chromatography data acquisition and processing system, glass
chromatography column, centrifuge, acidometer.

\subsection{Pre-treatment of egg white
	samples}\label{pre-treatment-of-egg-white-samples}}

Wash the egg shell, dry the outside of the shell, gently crack the
shell, pour the egg whites into a beaker, with the yolk intact, strain
the egg whites through 2 layers of gauze to remove the umbilical chunks
and shell fragments, then collect the egg white. Then dilute the egg
whites with Buffer1 to 1.5 times the original volume and stir with a
glass rod, filter with 6 layers of gauze, adjust the pH of the filtrate
with dilute hydrochloric acid to 4.5, rest for 20 min, centrifuge at 12
000 rpm for 10 min.

\hypertarget{purification-process}{%
\subsection{purification process}\label{purification-process}}

Purification of lysozyme by cation exchange

SDS-PAGE to check the purification effect

Molecular Sieve Chromatography

\hypertarget{concentration-measurement}{%
\subsection{concentration measurement}\label{concentration-measurement}}

The concentrations of proteins in each sample were determined using the
Comas Brilliant Blue G250 staining method.

\hypertarget{antibacterial-test}{%
\subsection{Antibacterial test}\label{antibacterial-test}}

Test bacteria (Bacillus coccoidus, Bacillus cereus, E. coli), delineate
on solid LB plate, cultivate at 35℃ for about 16h, pick single colony
and inoculate on liquid LB medium, cultivate at 35℃ for about 12h at
200rpm, get the liquid after activation, add the same concentration of
sample and measure the diameter of inhibition loop.
