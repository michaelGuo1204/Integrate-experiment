abstract = {Chemical bonding at the active site of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) is analyzed on the basis of Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules [QTAIM; Bader (1994), Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory. Oxford University Press] applied to electron-density maps derived from a multipole model. The observation is made that the atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) of HEWL at a temperature of 100 K are larger than ADPs in crystals of small biological molecules at 298 K. This feature shows that the ADPs in the cold crystals of HEWL reflect frozen-in disorder rather than thermal vibrations of the atoms. Directly generalizing the results of multipole studies on small-molecule crystals, the important consequence for electron-density analysis of protein crystals is that multipole parameters cannot be independently varied in a meaningful way in structure refinements. Instead, a multipole model for HEWL has been developed by refinement of atomic coordinates and ADPs against the X-ray diffraction data of Wang and coworkers [Wang et al. (2007), Acta Cryst. D63, 1254-1268], while multipole parameters were fixed to the values for transferable multipole parameters from the ELMAM2 database [Domagala et al. (2012), Acta Cryst. A68, 337-351]. Static and dynamic electron densities based on this multipole model are presented. Analysis of their topological properties according to the QTAIM shows that the covalent bonds possess similar properties to the covalent bonds of small molecules. Hydrogen bonds of intermediate strength are identified for the Glu35 and Asp52 residues, which are considered to be essential parts of the active site of HEWL. Furthermore, a series of weak C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are identified by means of the existence of bond critical points (BCPs) in the multipole electron density. It is proposed that these weak interactions might be important for defining the tertiary structure and activity of HEWL. The deprotonated state of Glu35 prevents a distinction between the Phillips and Koshland mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Union of Crystallography.},

abstract = {T HE X-ray analysis of the structure of hen egg-white lysozyme1 (N-acetylmuramide glycanohydrolase, EO 3.2.1.17), which was initiated in this Laboratory in 1960 by Dr. R. J. Poljak, has now produced a Fourier map of the electron density distribution at 2 A resolution in which the structure of the molecule can be clearly seen. Comparison of this map with the primary structure, determined by Jolles et al. 2 •3 , by Canfield4 •5 and in part by Brown•, has made possible the location of each of the 129 amino-acid residues of which the molecule is com- posed, many of which, including the four disulphide bridges, can be identified unambiguously in the X-ray image. The arrangement of groups in the molecule is very complicated, and many interactions between them will be revealed only by detailed analysis of the map. This preliminary account of the work is intended, therefore, to indicate the quality of the results, and to show the general structure of the molecule. Further work which is described in the following article 7 has also revealed the location of a site at which competitive inhibitor molecules are bound in the crystal structure so that it is possible, even at this stage, to identify amino-acid residues which may be involved in the binding of substrates.},

We found that the full HLH peptide of both chicken and human lysozymes was potently microbicidal against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans. The N-terminal helix of HLH was specifically bactericidal to Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the C-terminal helix was bactericidal to all tested strains. Outer and inner membrane permeabilization studies, as well as measurements of transmembrane electrochemical potentials, provided evidence that HLH peptide and its C-terminal helix domain kill Gram-negative bacteria by crossing the outer membrane via self-promoted uptake and causing damage to the inner membrane through channel formation.

abstract = {In order to broaden the antimicrobial action spectrum of lysozyme against Gram-negative bacteria, different partially reduced lysozyme derivatives were obtained by reducing the R-S-S-R bonds of lysozyme using the reducing agent Na 2 SO 3 . The circular dichroism behavior analysis showed that the tertiary structure of the partially reduced lysozyme molecules became more flexible, leading to an obvious increase in the surface hydrophobicity and the tryptophan fluorescence intensity. Zeta potential analysis indicated that the introduction of SO 32− led to a decrease in the surface charges of the reduced lysozyme molecules. Compared with the native lysozyme, the reduced lysozymes not only showed a 1 log increase in the antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076 (P <0.05), but also maintained nearly the same antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (P >0.05). Overall, the reductive modification with the food-friendly, compatible, and safe reducing agent Na 2 SO 3 has broadened the antimicrobial action spectrum of the modified lysozymes against Gram-negative bacteria, with the enhancement extent depending on the reduction degree and the type of bacterial strains. The integrated results suggest that the Na 2 SO 3 -reduced lysozyme can be used as a novel safe potential bactericidal additive for food-processing industry.},

abstract = {Lysozyme from egg white was modified by covalent attachment of an oleyl group to the free amino groups of lysozyme. The aim of the chemical modification was to develop an effective antimicrobial lysozyme derivative against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Lysozyme with various degrees of modification was obtained by changing oleoyl chloride/lysozyme mass ratio. Lysozyme derivatives evidently exhibited an antimicrobial effect against Escherichia coli (ATCC 29998). The modification slightly changed the antimicrobial effect of lysozyme derivative against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 121002). Since there was a positive correlation between the modification degree and the antimicrobial effect against E. coli, it was concluded that the change in antimicrobial behavior was due to an increase in hydrophobicity of the enzyme molecule enabling it to penetrate through the bacterial membrane of E. coli. It was also shown that oleoyl chloride with an MIC value of 10mg/mL was effective against both E. coli and S. aureus. Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Lysozyme is an antimicrobial peptide with a high enzymatic activity and positive charges. Therefore, it has applications in food and pharmaceutical industries as an antimicrobial agent. Lysozyme is ubiquitous in both animal and plant kingdoms. Currently, egg-white lysozyme is the most commercially available form of lysozyme. The main concerns of egg-white lysozyme are high recovery cost, low activity and most importantly the immunological problems to some people. Therefore, human lysozyme production has gained importance in recent years. Scientists have developed transgenic plants, animals and microorganisms that can produce human lysozyme. Out of these, microbial production has advantages for commercial productions, because high production levels are achievable in a relatively short time. It has been reported that fermentation parameters, such as pH, temperature, aeration, are key factors to increase the effectiveness of the human lysozyme production. Moreover, purification of the lysozyme from the fermentation broth needs to be optimized for the economical production. In conclusion, this review paper covers the mechanism of lysozyme, its sources, production methods and recovery of lysozyme.},

abstract = {Hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) was the first enzyme to have its three-dimensional structure determined by X-ray diffraction techniques. A catalytic mechanism, featuring a long-lived oxocarbenium-ion intermediate, was proposed on the basis of model-building studies. The 'Phillips' mechanism is widely held as the paradigm for the catalytic mechanism of $\beta$-glycosidases that cleave glycosidic linkages with net retention of configuration of the anomeric centre. Studies with other retaining $\beta$-glycosidases, however, provide strong evidence pointing to a common mechanism for these enzymes that involves a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, as previously postulated. Here we show, in three different cases using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, a catalytically competent covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate during the catalytic cycle of HEWL. We also show the three-dimensional structure of this intermediate as determined by X-ray diffraction. We formulate a general catalytic mechanism for all retaining $\beta$-glycosidases that includes substrate distortion, formation of a covalent intermediate, and the electrophilic migration of C1 along the reaction coordinate.},

abstract = {A. PELLEGRINI, U. THOMAS, R. VON FELLENBERG AND P. WILD. 1992. Bactericidal properties of aprotinin, a proteinase inhibitor and possibly a defence molecule in bovine species, and of chicken egg white lysozyme, known as muramidase, were investigated. Incubation of various bacteria in the presence of either aprotinin or lysozyme showed that both proteins killed Gram‐positive as well as Gram‐negative bacteria without addition of complement or EDTA. Denaturation of the two proteins by dithiothreitol did not lead to loss of their bactericidal potency. Electron microscopic examination of Escherichia coli incubated either with lysozyme or aprotinin revealed that the bacterial cytoplasms gradually disintegrated. Both aprotinin and lysozyme were demonstrated within the affected cytoplasm by immunogold labelling. The results suggest that the bactericidal potency of lysozyme is not only due to muramidase activity but also to its cationic and hydrophobic properties. The bactericidal activity of aprotinin is probably also related to both these properties rather than to its activity as proteinase inhibitor. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992, Wiley Blackwell.
