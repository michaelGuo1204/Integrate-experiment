abstract = {Conjugated protein-carbon nanotubes possess unique physicochemical properties that make them attractive to a wide range of applications. We explored the effects of covalent conjugation of lysozymes with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on its activity and stability. Lysozyme was conjugated onto carboxyl-functionalized SWCNTs through carbodiimide method. Post conjugation changes of the enzyme were investigated using fluorescence measurements to generate plots of protein unfolding at 0 and 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Gn-HCl) concentrations. Free lysozyme showed a remarkable increase in the fluorescence intensity at 287 nm in addition to a red shift from 343 to 352 nm. The emission spectrum of conjugated lysozyme showed a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity at 287 nm and a significant decrease in intensity at 348 nm. These results confirmed that both tryptophan and phenylalanine residues have an important role in the fluorescence bulk of both free and conjugated lysozymes. Kinetic parameters of free and conjugated lysozyme activities (KM and Vmax), optimum pH, thermal and pH stability, and stability in the presence of denaturant agents such as urea and salts were investigated. Changes were observed in KM and Vmax from 4.8 to 5.6 mM and 193 to 197 nmol min-1, respectively. Conjugated lysozyme showed a remarkable increase in pH stability in a range of 3.0 to 10.0 at 70 °C. The results showed first-order inactivation kinetics for both forms of lysozyme with a rate constant of about 0.139 min-1 for 10 minutes of incubation at 70 °C in the presence of KCl and KSCN.},

abstract = {Innate human salivary defence proteins, lysozyme, lactoferrin and peroxidase, are known to exert a wide antimicrobial activity against a number of bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens in vitro. Therefore, these proteins, alone or in combinations, have been incorporated as preservatives in foods and pharmaceuticals as well as in oral health care products to restore salivas' own antimicrobial capacity in patients with dry mouth. These antimicrobials used in oral health care products, such as dentifrices, mouth-rinses, moisturizing gels and chewing gums, have been purified from bovine colostrum. In this review I critically evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of this kind of preventive approach against various oral diseases and symptoms.},

abstract = {Lysozyme was integrated into chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) to improve the antibacterial activity. CS-NPs and chitosan-lysozyme nanoparticles (CS-Lys-NPs) were prepared according to the ionic gelation technique and then characterized by average size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), atomic force microscopy (AFM), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), circular dichroism (CD) and UV–visible spectroscopy. Antibacterial properties were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) based on observation of the inhibition zone and measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bacterial concentration (MBC) of CS-NPs and CS-Lys-NPs against E. coli and B. subtilis. The CS-NPs had particle sizes of 476.2–548.1 nm, while an increase to ∼488.8 to 613.5 nm was observed upon loading with lysozyme. The results suggested that the integration of lysozyme into CS-NPs enhanced the antibacterial activity against E. coli and B. subtilis, which may show great potential for use in the food industry and other applications in the form of direct addition or incorporation into packaging.},

abstract = {A new technique for the immobilization of lysozyme onto the surface of polyvinylalcohol films is presented. The active compound was sprayed along with a suitable bonding agent onto the surface of the cross-linked polymeric matrix. Active compound release tests determined the amount of lysozyme immobilized on the film surface. With the use of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, the antimicrobial activity of the films was determined and the results correlated with the amount of immobilized lysozyme. This new technique was effective for immobilizing the enzyme, and the developed films were active against the test microorganism. Results were compared with those obtained with a different immobilizing technique, in which the active compound was bound into the bulk of the polymeric film. As expected, the surface-immobilized lysozyme films have a higher antimicrobial activity than bulk-bound films. Copyright {\textcopyright}, International Association for Food Protection.},

@article{Alhazmi2014,
abstract = {Lysozyme has attracted immense attention as an antimicrobial agent because of its ability to lyse the bacterial cell wall. It is found in a wide variety of body fluids and in cells of the innate immune system. Lysozyme can act as muramidase or as a Cationic Antimicrobial Peptide (CAMP). Lysozyme has many applications in the medical and industrial fields. Based on enzyme nomenclature, lysozyme is classified as a glycosylase under the group hydrolases. This manuscript covers a fundamental review of lysozyme in terms of discovery, history, functions and various sources and types of lysozyme. The biological and molecular structure is discussed as well as notable bioengineering and protein modifications. Furthermore, the mechanisms of resistance to lysozyme in microorganisms have also been discussed. Lastly, different methods that have been developed for detecting and measuring the activity of lysozyme are outlined. Although, a recombinant lysozyme has not yet been produced, several studies have attempted to generate a modified lysozyme either for large-scale production or that which is more suitable for industrialization purposes.},

@article{Lian2012,
abstract = {In this manuscript, we describe the process of immobilizing lysozyme onto a chitosan powder surface using different methods, and we assess the antimicrobial characteristics of the immobilized lysozyme when acting as an edible coating. The immobilized enzyme retained 72.50{\%} of the specific activity of free enzyme when the covalent attachment procedure was utilized. The properties of the immobilized enzyme, including optimum pH and temperature, reusability, storage stability and kinetic parameters, were also examined. Compared to free and immobilized enzyme, the covalently immobilized lysozyme exhibited remarkable characteristics on optimum pH (6.0) and temperature (65 °C), and storage stability. The covalently bound enzyme maintained approximately 80{\%} of its initial activity after 14 cycles, and the K m and V max were found to be 28.17 $\mu$g/ml and 1.41 × 10 4 U/mg, respectively. In addition, the antimicrobial effect of the immobilized lysozyme was monitored when applied as part of a whey protein concentrate and chitosan coating. The data indicated that the active coating was effective in inhibiting the growth of Escherichia coli O157: H7 (CICC 21530) and Staphylococcus aureus (CICC 21600) for a week. The study demonstrates the potential for the use of immobilized lysozyme as an antimicrobial component for antimicrobial packaging. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
