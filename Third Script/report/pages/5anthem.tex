During the experiment, we encountered various difficutlies. We hereby express our appreciation to Professor Y. Kong and H. Li. Professor Kong is strict with us on the operations of experiments. He provided us with huge amount of useful resources, like experimental facilities. Li helped us organize all regents, and taught us patiently about how the instruments operates. They also gave us valuable advice in the process of the experiments, helping to direct us to success. 

This course is a precious experience for us. We group members work together from deciding the topic, to making plans and summarizing protocols. If there's problems, we ask help from classmates and teachers. Everything is done by ourselves so we are deeply trained in both experimental design and hands-on abilities. We think we benefit more from it than some other courses that we do actually what the teacher assigns. Of course, this course consumes more resourses and burns teachers' energy. Thus, we are expressing our gratitude to everyone who once helped us!
